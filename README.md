# Wordle Game

This is a Wordle game inspired by React Wordle based on the original wordle.

It has two modes: daily mode and random word mode. In daily mode, you get a new puzzle every day. In random word mode, you can play as many puzzles as you want.

## How to Play

1. Guess the hidden word in 6 tries.
2. Each guess must be a valid 5-letter word.
3. The color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
